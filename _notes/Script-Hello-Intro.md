Hello Processing Introduction
Draft #1
5 November, 2013


[Camera on Dan]

When we think of computer programming, we might think of engineering, mathematics, and science. Programming did emerge from these fields, but, for over fifty years, people have been making art by writing computer programs. Fifty years is a long time, a lot of history. Amazing things have been made by artists and designers who write their own code. Let's take a look at a wide range of things that were made recently.

[1. Strata #3 – Quayola (Video)] pronunciation: kway-oh-la

This is Strata Number 3 by Quayola. Quayola is an artist working in London.
This animation combines computer-generated images with video of a cathedral in Rome to create a fantastic new reality. In his own words, he is “investigating improbable relationships between contemporary digital aesthetics and icons of classical art and architecture.”

[2. Oasis - Yunsil Heo (Video)]

This is Oasis by Yunsil Heo. She is a media artist working in Seoul. Oasis is an interactive installation. By moving around the sand, small pools are created where new software creatures are born and live. 

[2.5. Replica – Alex Vessels, Jeff Howard (Video and pan scan – Note, we can't use the sound)]

This is Replica by Alex Vessels and Jeff Howard. Alex and Jeff are interactive artists and designers working in New York. Replica is an interactive dance performance that uses live image processing to explore how the awareness of time and captured images affects self-perception. It was projected onto a 120 foot video wall in New York.

[3. Unnamed Sound Sculpture - Daniel Franke & Cedric Kiefer (Video)]  Pronunciation:  Frahnk-eh, Keefer

This is Unnamed Sound Sculpture by Daniel Franke and Cedric Kiefer. Daniel and Cedric are media artists working in Berlin. This animation is a moving sculpture created from the recorded motion data of a live dancer.

These animation and installation projects are just one way that visual artists are working with code. More traditional design area such as map design, brand identity and logo design, and illustration are also transformed through designers writing their own code.

[4. Dencity - Fathom Information Design (Pan/scan image)]

This is the Dencity map by Fathom Information design. Fathom is a design studio in Boston. This map uses circles of different sizes and colors to visualize population density in a unique way. Larger, darker circles show areas with fewer people, while smaller, brighter circles highlight crowded cities. By glancing at this map, we quickly get a sense of how some cities and countries are more densely populated than others.

[6. MIT Media Lab - The Green Eyl (Video)]  Pronunciation: Isle

This is the logo for the MIT Media lab, created by the The Green Eyl. The Green Eyl is a studio based in Berlin. The identity system can be used in different way in many contexts including the lab's website, business cards and in any other media. It forms a mutable identity that is synonymous with the Media Lab’s approach to the ever-changing nature of technology.

Think of the wide range of the visual arts. In addition to the kind of work we've looked at already, there's sculpture, fashion design, architecture, products, jewelry, pottery, and much more. What does writing software have to do with these physical objects? Everything! It's an area of exciting and emerging possibility. New technologies make it possible to print objects. For example, it's now possible to design a ring in software and to print it in plastic or metal. Let's look at three final examples before starting to learn how to code.

[7. D.dress - Mary Huang (Video, also Pan/scan image)], pronunciation: mary whaang

This is the D.dress software by Mary Huang. Mary is an entrepreneur and designer working in New York. D.dress is a program written by Mary that allows a user to sketch a dress and then automates the pattern creation. It re-imagines the classic “little black dress” by changing the relationships between manufacturing, the designer, and the wearer.


[8. Textile Room – P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S (Video)] pronunciation: Uhl-hich, speena

The Textile room was created by the architecture studio P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S, founded by Georgina Huljich And Marcelo Spina. Georgina and Marcelo are architects working in Los Angeles. The Textile Room is an experimental media space where carbon-fiber textiles are augmented with a video collage.


[9. Nervous System - Cell Cycle (Video)]

This is Cell Cycle by Nervous System, a design studio founded by Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg. Jessica and Jesse are entrepreneurs and designers living in Boston. Cell Cycle is a program that allows people to design their own jewelry and then 3D print it.

All of the projects we just looked at were created with a software environment called Processing. Processing is a way to program invented by artists and designers to be used by artists and designers. Processing is for making visual media. It focuses on writing programs to draw, create animation, and to to build interactive experiences like video games.

Before we start writing our own programs, let's first try to answer this question: "What is programming?"
