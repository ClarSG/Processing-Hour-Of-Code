00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:05,571
Hi! Welcome back! You came back, which I'm very thankful for — thank you very much.

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:09,600
So, hopefully you enjoyed the last exercise you did, and your code is still sitting down there.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,628
Now, by the way, during this section of the tutorial, I am going to start doing stuff,

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,887
and the code that you wrote is going to disappear.

5
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,331
But don't worry; there's going to be an option for you to restore it again later.

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:23,134
OK, so what are we missing? We've got shapes: we've got circles, we've got rectangles.

7
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:26,714
But obviously we're missing something really important in terms of art and design.

8
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:27,717
We're missing color.

9
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,474
So let's think about that rectangle again.

10
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:32,003
We have this rectangle.

11
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,403
We have this circle.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,510
What do these shapes have? They have both an outline, which is tracing this rectangle,

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,789
which we're going to call — sorry — the "stroke." We also have the interior of the shape,

14
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,752
the interior of the shape which we're going to call the "fill."

15
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:55,746
So we have two colors that we have to set for every shape.

16
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:59,780
We have the stroke, which is the outline, and we have the fill, which is the interior.

17
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,476
And just like we learnd these function calls, these commands —

18
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:08,529
"rect" for rectangle, "ellipse" for ellipse — we're going to have functions for stroke and fill.

19
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:10,218
So it's going to look like this.

20
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:15,813
Let's say we're drawing a rectangle, and that rectangle is being drawn at some location.

21
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:18,858
Uh, I think this is something we had previously.

22
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:30,255
What we need to do now, before we say "rectangle" is we need to say "stroke" and we need to say "fill."

23
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,786
Every single time that we draw a shape, if we want to color it,

24
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:39,194
we need to set the stroke and fill before we call that shape function.

25
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,943
This is, again, a moment when order of operations matter.

26
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:45,891
We don't say, "draw a rectangle — hey it's blue, and it's red on the outside."

27
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:48,443
We say, "set a pen color..." (in a way it's like a pen)....

28
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:52,224
"Go and find my red pen and go and find my blue marker.

29
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:56,716
You use the red pen for the outside and the blue marker for the inside" when I draw that rectangle.

30
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,902
But there's a big question here, right? We know that when we draw a rectangle we give it an x, a y,

31
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:04,941
a width, and height: those are the values that define what it is to be a rectangle.

32
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:09,890
What values do we give a stroke or a fill? How do we tie numbers to color?

33
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,829
Let's say we have the number 0, and we say the number 0 means black.

34
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:21,656
And let's say we have the number 255, and the number 255 means white.

35
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:26,054
So any value in between, any value in between is some gray.

36
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,535
127 would be, like, half the way between white and black.

37
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:34,399
253 would be really white, but not all the way white.

38
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,929
Right? So can really imagine this and obviously just trying out these numbers would make much more sense.

39
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:44,048
So we could say something like "stroke (0)" and we would have a black outline.

40
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,939
Let's actually bring up the code editor below,

41
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,979
and let's add a stroke (0) and a fill for one of our shapes down there, for the rectangle below.

42
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:59,571
OK, see how the stroke and fill are placed before we call rect, and that they are setting the colors that you're seeing in the canvas on the left.

43
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:00,595
Great.

44
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,353
So, I want to move on quickly though, however, to … even though this is nice,

45
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:07,703
and we can see that we can do grayscale colors, really,

46
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:10,805
what you probably want to do is make all sorts of … you know, what's your favorite color?

47
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:15,341
Pink? Purple? Green? Blue? You want to make "color" color, how do we do that?

48
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:21,323
So, with one number — if we put one number here in stroke, we have a grayscale color,

49
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:27,736
but if we put three numbers in, like if I put numbers like this (255, 0, 0),

50
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:32,500
what we now have done is we've created an RGB color.

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,409
RGB: we have a little bit of red, we have some amount of green, and we have some amount of blue.

52
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,887
The arguments are red, green, and blue.

53
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:46,388
And it has the same … it follows the same scale as grayscale.

54
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:52,804
In the case of red, 255 is all the red you could imagine; 0 is no red.

55
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:53,802
So it's like mixing colors.

56
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:57,252
I mean, it's something you might have done, um, you know, fingerpainting, or mixing colors,

57
00:03:57,252 --> 00:04:00,005
and you get a little red, you get a little blue, and you put them together,

58
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,820
and I think maybe you get purple, something like that.

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,722
Um, this same principle is happening here.

60
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:08,671
You're adding a variable amount of red, a variable amount of blue and mixing colors.

61
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:11,970
The thing that you should realize, though, is it's not like mixing paints,

62
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,052
that what color actually does on the computer is really like mixing light.

63
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:19,935
It's more like imagining that you had three flashlights — a red flashlight, a green flashlight,

64
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:24,692
and a blue flashlight — and you could turn them up or down and shine them on the same point.

65
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:29,910
So let's switch over again and open up the code editor below, and let's add a stroke and a fill.

66
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,618
The stroke and the fill are still there from rectangle.

67
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:38,522
Let's make the stroke red, which would be all red, (255, 0, 0),

68
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:44,185
and let's make a fill that's all blue, (0, 0, 255).

69
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,436
Let's run that, and now we see a red outline with a blue interior.

70
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:52,173
You probably want lots of other colors, and it might be hard to figure out what color do I want?

71
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:57,475
Well, if you notice, if you click on fill, and I'm going to do this for you, a wheel (a color picker)

72
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,928
pops up where you could move the mouse around and you can select the color you want,

73
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:05,375
and it shows you what are the red, what are the green, and what are the blue values for that color.

74
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:11,251
So, you can type in your values manually or you can use the color picker to set values.

75
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:16,857
We know now how to set the outline or the fill, the stroke or the fill of these shapes.

76
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:20,483
But remember, there is this canvas that we're drawing into.

77
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:25,043
But what if you want, actually, to fill in a color in the background?

78
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:29,619
So there is one more function that we are going to learn as part of this little tutorial,

79
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,528
which is "background ()".

80
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:35,402
So, I'm going to add that now to the code editor below, background (),

81
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,606
and I'm going to put a color in there that's a nice, soft yellow.

82
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,901
And then now we're going to run it.

83
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,584
We're going to see that yellow is the background.

84
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,464
So, why don't you take a minute, actually.

85
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:48,197
Try the color picker on the background, and pick a different color.

86
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,619
You're going to have to press "run your code" when you're ready.

87
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,571
Did the color you picked appear in the background? Hopefully it did.

88
00:05:57,571 --> 00:06:01,350
OK, so this really wraps up the end of this section about color.

89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,715
You know, what did we first do? We first learned we could put rectangles and ellipses of any size

90
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:08,281
anywhere on the screen.

91
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:13,531
Now we can assign any of them different strokes, different fills, and we can put a background color.

92
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,383
I'm going to put below an example for you to start with.

93
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:19,459
It's a nice design that has a bunch of shapes and a bunch of colors in it.

94
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,352
You can use this, tweak it to make your own design, or — you'll also see when this video ends —

95
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:29,683
there will be an option for you to revert back to your previous code that you had at the end of lesson 1.

96
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:33,183
So if you want to go find that creature or alien you made and start adding color to it,

97
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,370
that's what you could do for this exercise.

98
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,742
I'll talk to you later, and enjoy this exercise.
