00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:03,099
Hi. How are you? My name is Dan. Welcome.

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:05,618
If you're here, which hopefully you are
because you're watching this video,

3
00:00:05,618 --> 00:00:07,150
you're here to learn Programming.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,745
Hopefully you're here to learn Programming
for the very first time.

5
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:11,216
This is going to be a tutorial.

6
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:13,946
It's designed for you to take about 
an hour to complete.

7
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,607
There's going to be lots of stuff
happening in it.

8
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,139
I'm going to talk. Hopefully not too much.

9
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,399
I'm going to draw pictures and diagrams

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,997
over here on this whiteboard.

11
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:22,309
Sometimes this video is going to

12
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:23,594
get a lot smaller and there's going to be

13
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,195
text below me, and things drawn

14
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,073
to the left of me over here.

15
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:28,293
We're going to look at Programming

16
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:30,261
in the context of the visual arts.

17
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,137
What does it mean to write software

18
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:33,451
to do the things that you often do

19
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,403
with your hands, with paper, with pencil

20
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,345
with paint? Could you use a computer to

21
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:39,603
create drawings? To create animations?

22
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:42,109
To create images? This is what we're
going to look at.

23
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,684
So, before we get started with the actual

24
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,597
nuts and bolts of learning to code,

25
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,472
let's take a moment to look at a range of

26
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,327
projects -- things that have been made in

27
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,919
recent years with computer programming

28
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,641
for the visual arts.

29
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,061
This is Strata #3 by Quayola.

30
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:57,068
Quayola is an artist working in London.

31
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:59,037
This animation combines computer generated

32
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,314
images with video of a cathedral in Rome

33
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,475
to create a fantastic new reality.

34
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:07,009
In his own words, he is investigating 
improbable relationships between

35
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:11,840
contemporary digital aesthetics, and 
icons of classical art and architecture.

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,331
This is Oasis by Yunsil Heo.

37
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,394
She is a media artist working in Seoul.

38
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:18,548
Oasis is an interactive installation.

39
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:21,111
By moving around the sand,
small pools are created

40
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,206
where new software creatures are born and live.

41
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:27,112
This is Replica by Alex Vessels and Jeff Howard.

42
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,396
Alex and Jeff are interactive artists and designers

43
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,461
working in New York. Replica is

44
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,178
an interactive dance performance that

45
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,717
uses live image processing to explore how

46
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,817
the awareness of time and captured images

47
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:39,669
affect self-perception.

48
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:43,055
It was projected onto a 120 foot
video wall in New York.

49
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:46,365
This is unnamed soundsculpture by

50
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:49,225
Daniel Franke and Cedric Kiefer.

51
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:52,133
Daniel and Cedric are media artists
working in Berlin.

52
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,040
This animation is a moving sculpture

53
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,362
created from the recorded motion data
of a live dancer.

54
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,986
These animation and installation projects

55
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,585
are just one way that visual artists

56
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:05,845
are working with code.

57
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:07,282
More traditional design areas such as

58
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,033
map design, brand identity, and logo design

59
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,828
and illustration are transformed through

60
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,984
designers writing their own code.

61
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,637
This is the Dencity Map by

62
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:16,296
Fathom Information Design.

63
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,161
Fathom is a design studio in Boston.

64
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,949
This map uses circles of different sizes

65
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,109
and colors to visualize

66
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,508
population density in a unique way.

67
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,517
Larger, darker circles show areas

68
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,745
with fewer people. While smaller brighter

69
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,970
circles highlight crowded cities.

70
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,661
By glancing at this map we quickly get

71
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,629
a sense of how some cities and countries

72
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,982
are more densely populated than others.

73
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,555
This is the logo for the MIT Media Lab

74
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,335
created by the Green Eyl.

75
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,933
The Green Eyl is a studio based in Berlin.

76
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,433
The identity system can be used

77
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,247
in different ways and in many contexts

78
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,323
including the lab's website, business cards,

79
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:51,229
and in any other media.

80
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,855
It forms a beautiful identity that is

81
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:54,264
synonymous with the Media Lab's

82
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:55,542
approach to the ever changing

83
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,012
nature of technology.

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,180
In addition to the kind of work

85
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,639
we're looking at already,

86
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,076
there's sculpture, fashion design,

87
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,551
architecture, products, jewelry,

88
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,712
pottery, much much more.

89
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,025
What does writing software have

90
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,807
to do with these physical objects?

91
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,837
Everything.

92
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:12,398
It's an area of exciting and emerging possibility.

93
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,871
New technologies make it possible

94
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,591
to print objects. For example, it is now

95
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,501
possible to design a ring in software

96
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,755
and print it in plastic or metal.

97
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,888
Let's look at three final examples before starting

98
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:23,743
to learn how to code.

99
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:25,478
This is the D.dress software by

100
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,386
Mary Huang. Mary is an entrepreneur

101
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,514
and designer working in New York.

102
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:31,078
D.dress is a program written by Mary

103
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,432
that allows a user to sketch a dress and

104
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,591
it automates the pattern creation.

105
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,840
It re-imagines the classic little black dress

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,536
by changing the relationships between

107
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:42,295
manufacturing, the designer, and the wearer.

108
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,384
The Textile Room was created by the

109
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,389
architecture studio P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S,

110
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,058
founded by Georgina Huljich

111
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,783
and Marcelo Spina. Georgina and Marcelo

112
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,981
are architects working in Los Angeles,

113
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,669
The Textile Room is an experimental

114
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,014
media space where carbon fiber textiles

115
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:59,502
are augmented with a video colleague.

116
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:02,563
This is Cell Cycle by Nervous System,

117
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:04,472
a design studio founded by Jessica Rosenkrantz

118
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,692
and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg.

119
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,350
Jessica and Jesse are entrepreneurs

120
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,421
and designers living in Boston.

121
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,952
Cell Cycle is a program that allows

122
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,765
people to design their own jewelry

123
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,956
and then 3D print it.

124
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,873
All of these projects we just looked at

125
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,661
are created with a software environment

126
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,786
called Processing. Processing is a way

127
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,598
to program invented by artists

128
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,723
and designers to be used by

129
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,098
artists and designers.

130
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,760
Processing is for making visual media.

131
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,363
It focuses on writing programs to draw

132
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:30,996
create animation, and to build

133
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,313
interactive experiences like video games.

134
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:35,002
Hopefully you're going to have a good

135
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,693
experience learning to program

136
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,286
and I'm already having fun just talking to you

137
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,569
even though I don't really know

138
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,228
who you are yet cause you're not here.

139
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:42,638
There's a camera there. Okay.

140
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:43,891
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
