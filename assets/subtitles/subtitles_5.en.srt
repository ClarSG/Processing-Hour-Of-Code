1
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:02,490
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,401
We've got one more tutorial here

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:06,909
in this hour of learning to program with Processing.

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:08,620
So, one of the things you might have noticed

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,471
is that our programs, while they animate now,

6
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:13,640
they kind of just do the same thing always.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,243
But what if, for example, you wanted your program

8
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:18,118
to sometimes draw circles on the screen

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,409
and other times draw squares on the screen.

10
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,211
Computer programs can take a different path.

11
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:24,897
They can sometimes do one thing

12
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:26,754
and they can sometimes do other things.

13
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,519
And the way that they do this is by answering a question.

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,243
If the answer to this question is "yes"

15
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:32,460
draw a square.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,071
If the answer to this question is "no"

17
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:35,542
draw a circle.

18
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:37,387
A yes or no question is often sometimes

19
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:40,684
referred to as a true or false question. Right?

20
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,972
We can think of like taking a true or false test.

21
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:45,257
And if the answer is true, draw the square.

22
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:47,457
If the answer is false, draw the circle.

23
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:49,711
So we need to figure out how to make our programs

24
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,060
take different paths.

25
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,642
What might be a question that we would ask,

26
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:55,300
for example? We could say, "Hey! Is the mouse pressed?"

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,444
If the mouse is pressed, do draw that square.

28
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:00,703
If the mouse is not pressed, draw that circle.

29
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:02,399
And this can get more and more advanced

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,685
in more advanced programs.

31
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:04,873
And you can think of a game --

32
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:06,746
If these two objects run into each other,

33
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:08,784
make a nice little pretty heart appear.

34
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,948
I don't know. That might be a nice thing.

35
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:11,734
Whatever.

36
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,018
The point is, we can have,

37
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,720
based on certain things that happen,

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,094
based on questions that have the answer

39
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:17,313
yes or no,

40
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:18,376
other things can happen.

41
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,221
And our program can take a different path.

42
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,846
So let's look at how we do this.

43
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,785
By the way, this is known as

44
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:28,827
a conditional statement.

45
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:29,861
This is one of the fundamental

46
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,368
building blocks of programming.

47
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,147
Writing conditional statements.

48
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:35,126
And the syntax of what we're actually going to write,

49
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,794
it looks like this.

50
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:41,461
If, parentheses, some empty space,

51
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,286
another curly bracket,

52
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,666
and another closed curly bracket.

53
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,549
If, we could ask a question.

54
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,954
Is it raining outside?

55
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,177
If the answer is yes, execute some code

56
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,549
that goes here.

57
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,020
What is the code that might go here?

58
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,727
Carry your umbrella.

59
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,324
If the answer to that question is no,

60
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,636
we're not going to do this code.

61
00:01:58,636 --> 00:01:59,863
We're going to go and find out

62
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,991
whatever code is there --

63
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,465
drawing rectangles, ellipses.

64
00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,808
So, this is how we can have a program

65
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,633
answer a yes or no question.

66
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,411
A true or false question.

67
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,012
And what, one of the things we're going to look at,

68
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,608
as our example of this

69
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:15,648
is saying, if mousePressed.

70
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:18,838
mousePressed is a word that Processing knows.

71
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,353
It's like asking the question

72
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:21,920
"Is the mouse pressed?"

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,367
This word is true when the mouse is pressed

74
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,923
and it is false when the mouse is not pressed.

75
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,361
So, if I were to write

76
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:33,325
rectangle here

77
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,764
then only when the mouse is pressed

78
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,485
would I draw a rectangle.

79
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,366
Okay. Let's take a look at that below.

80
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,102
So I'm going to make a basic example below

81
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,850
where there is a circle on the screen.

82
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,853
It's not doing much but there's a

83
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,510
circle on the screen.

84
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,543
Now, I'm going to add to this -- the code below

85
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:49,282
this "if" statement, this conditional statement

86
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,970
with a rectangle drawn when

87
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,757
the mouse is pressed.

88
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,605
Now I'm going to run that code.

89
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:56,736
Go and click in the window over here.

90
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:58,207
What happens when you click?

91
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,029
Only when you hold that mouse down

92
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,569
the rectangle appears.

93
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,011
As soon as you let the mouse up,

94
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,643
the rectangle disappears.

95
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,912
This is the power of conditional statements.

96
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,569
You allow your program to sometimes

97
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,881
do something one way and

98
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,047
sometimes do something another way.

99
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,957
Okay. There's a bit more.

100
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,471
We're almost done but there's a bit more

101
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:17,285
to that than this.

102
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,142
What if we want the program to draw nothing?

103
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:22,303
But draw a rectangle when the mouse is pressed.

104
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,828
Otherwise draw an ellipse.

105
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:26,255
The word we use in computer programming

106
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,163
is not otherwise, it's else.

107
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:31,387
Else, and another curly bracket,

108
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,146
and another curly bracket

109
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:37,266
and we can put ellipse here.

110
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,672
So when the answer to the question

111
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,991
mousePressed is yes,

112
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,218
or true,

113
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,781
we're going to execute this code.

114
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,315
When the answer is no,

115
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:49,286
or false,

116
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,354
we're going to execute this code.

117
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:54,060
This allows us to have multiple permutations

118
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,751
of different scenarios.

119
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,061
And we can add as many of these

120
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,480
if statements to our program.

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,455
We can have a series of three or four of them.

122
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,156
Let's revise that example now and add an else.

123
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:04,883
So the ellipse is going to be drawn --

124
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,475
or the rectangle is going to be drawn

125
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:08,514
when the mouse is pressed, else,

126
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:12,497
otherwise an ellipse is going to be drawn.

127
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:15,266
So now try clicking in the window over there.

128
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,627
If you're clicking I see a rectangle, right?

129
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:19,692
If you let go I see an ellipse.

130
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,628
It's one or the other.

131
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,788
I've already forgotten.

132
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,512
But I think you get the idea.

133
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,060
So I'm going to load our painting program

134
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,500
that we finished with at the end of our

135
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,476
third video tutorial, below.

136
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:33,237
Now, if you paint in the window,

137
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,427
you can paint as long as you want.

138
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,621
Make all sorts of wonderful patterns

139
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,713
and draw your name,

140
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:38,378
and smiley faces and rainbows

141
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,940
whatever you want. It's never going to erase.

142
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,664
What if we said,

143
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:47,380
If the mouse is pressed, draw the background.

144
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,256
So only when you're holding down the mouse,

145
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,416
the background is drawn,

146
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,302
effectively erasing everything that you've painted.

147
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,491
We now have a program

148
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:55,191
that as you move the mouse in the window,

149
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,413
it draws.

150
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:59,549
When you click the mouse, it erases.

151
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,108
We could also do the opposite.

152
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:02,866
What if you only draw when you're

153
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,073
moving the mouse?

154
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:05,021
So you have to hold down the mouse,

155
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,496
draw, you could let go, move over here,

156
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:07,691
draw some more.

157
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,351
That might be something you choose

158
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,527
to try to implement as an exercise.

159
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,342
Okay. So this wraps up this last video tutorial

160
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:15,824
about learning to program with Processing.

161
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,801
We've done actually quite a bit of stuff.

162
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,376
We've learned about coordinate systems.

163
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,354
shapes. We've learned about color, gray-scale,

164
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,670
and RGB. We've learned about the flow of a program.

165
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,982
How it has a set-up and a draw

166
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:26,625
and loops over time and things can animate

167
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,032
and move with the mouse.

168
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:29,705
And now we've learned about how a program

169
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,371
can create different paths and do something

170
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,309
different based on whether the mouse

171
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,686
is clicked or not.

172
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:36,131
So this is a time where you can spend

173
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,639
a little moment to explore this idea of

174
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,325
the conditional statement.

175
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:40,796
If you go back to your painting program

176
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,519
you could try adding something where

177
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,841
it's painting one way when you're

178
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,143
holding down the mouse,

179
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:46,145
and painting a different way when you're

180
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,612
not holding down the mouse.

181
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:48,870
You could try clearing the background

182
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,111
in the conditional statement,

183
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,993
all sorts of possible things you could try.

184
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,146
So work with conditional statements

185
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,926
in this exercise.

186
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,834
I'm going to leave you with a simple

187
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,959
painting program that uses

188
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,803
a conditional, below.

189
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,526
But you can always revert back to your code

190
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:02,717
from the last time,

191
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:03,713
just as you always have.

192
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:05,284
So, take a little time to do this exercise,

193
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,474
when you're done, click next

194
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,632
and it will be one last wrap up video.

195
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,659
We'll kind of say goodbye, and I'll also

196
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,416
show you how you can share your code

197
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,304
and save it so that you can come back

198
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:15,646
and look at it again later,

199
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,134
as well as look for resources,

200
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,228
for how you might, hopefully

201
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,088
if you're excited and interested in this,

202
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,835
there's lots more to learn. Right?

203
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,150
This is just the beginning.

204
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,526
We've just scratched the surface.

205
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:26,030
And there's more resources online,

206
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,601
through books, and other websites

207
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,321
that will help you continue this process.

208
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,636
Okay? So, see you after you

209
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,868
complete this exercise.
