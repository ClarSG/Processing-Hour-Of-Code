00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,871
Hi so we finished the tutorial.

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,716
You did it! You learned the program

3
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:06,557
in about an hour.

4
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:07,437
That's pretty amazing

5
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:08,249
if you think about it.

6
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,337
What you have done is

7
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:10,727
you've written lines of code.

8
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:11,948
You've run that code.

9
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:13,068
You've made things animate.

10
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:14,599
You've made different colors.

11
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,547
You've taken those first

12
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:16,516
steps in creating your own

13
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,418
software. And now there's

14
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,776
just this huge world of

15
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:20,780
possibilities bursting

16
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,780
open to you.

17
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,780
When I leave you here

18
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,590
you're going to have

19
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,500
a couple of choices.

20
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,499
You can go back to

21
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:26,249
the code editor and

22
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,060
work on what you were

23
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,059
making more. And there

24
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:28,968
will actually be a new option

25
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,870
there. To share what you

26
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,998
made. You can share

27
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,218
what you made with friends

28
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:34,281
and save it to come back

29
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:35,623
and work on it more later.

30
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,761
I'm also going to leave you

31
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:37,765
with a bunch of hopefully

32
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,795
helpful links, places you

33
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:41,270
can go to to learn more about

34
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,390
programming with processing.

35
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,806
Other resources to take this

36
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,278
further. One of the things

37
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,153
you probably would most

38
00:00:47,153 --> 00:00:48,367
want to do is go to the processing

39
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,268
website and actually download

40
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:51,391
processing which is an

41
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,214
application that you run

42
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,729
on your computer. It has many

43
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,028
more features. Many more

44
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:55,835
examples that you can

45
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,183
take a look at. So there's also

46
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,498
a link below to the processing

47
00:00:58,498 --> 00:00:59,563
forum where you can go and

48
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:01,439
post and ask questions. I'll be

49
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,718
checking the forum and trying

50
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:03,508
to answer your questions

51
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:04,395
as well as many other

52
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:05,400
members of the processing

53
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,630
community. So hopefully we'll

54
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,661
get to make more of these

55
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,442
tutorials in the future. So

56
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,412
I'd love to hear your feedback

57
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:10,382
about what was helpful and

58
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:12,408
what was not helpful. And

59
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:13,442
I look forward to seeing

60
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:14,347
all the things that people

61
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,178
make. And more people

62
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,300
using processing and asking

63
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,427
questions and inventing stuff

64
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:20,082
with code. So thanks again

65
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:20,976
for being here. I had a

66
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:21,918
great time. I hope you did

67
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,633
too. And I'll talk to you soon.

68
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,851
Okay. Bye-bye.
