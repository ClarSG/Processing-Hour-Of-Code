1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:03,285
ï»¿Alright, we're ready to get started.

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:04,702
This is a very exciting moment,

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:08,799
'cause we're actually going to look at writing lines of code and drawing stuff to the screen.

4
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,799
So, what does it mean to write a line of code, right?

5
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,550
A line of code is an instruction.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,612
What is the instruction we're going to start with?

7
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:17,647
The instruction we're going to start with is "draw a rectangle."

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,876
So let's see, what is a rectangle? I think we all know what a rectangle is, hopefully.

9
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,039
A rectangle is something that looks like this.

10
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:30,219
So what does it mean, then, to have an instruction that says "draw a rectangle?"

11
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,772
Well an instruction is text, and that instruction is going to look like this "rect."

12
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,999
A function is essentially that command, that instruction.

13
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:44,191
It's the word we use, and the function of "rect" is to draw a rectangle in the window.

14
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,634
So now, we have this function named "rect," we have this rectangle,

15
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,635
but we can't just say "draw a rectangle,"

16
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,915
we've got to be more specific, right?

17
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:54,276
I can't just tell you to "walk."

18
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:58,126
I might want to tell you to walk left or walk right or walk fast or walk slow.

19
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:04,525
To make a rectangle with "rect," we've got to say how wide should the rectangle be,

20
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:08,672
how high, how tall should the rectangle be, and where should it be on the screen?

21
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:11,212
Let's actually start for a moment with where should it be on the screen.

22
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,249
First, what do I even mean by "screen?"

23
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:16,279
You've got this computer screen, I'm in your computer screen, right?

24
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,931
The screen is a rectangle.

25
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:21,558
We're going to be drawing into a smaller rectangle inside your computer screen;

26
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,089
we're going to call that a canvas.

27
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:29,638
So I'm gonna draw a nice big rectangle here, and this is going to be the canvas.

28
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,754
The canvas is a coordinate system, meaning we can say

29
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:37,014
"hey, this point is the point 12, 27,"

30
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,676
or this point is the point 3, 102, those numbers aren't right,

31
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:46,532
but we're going to assign places in this canvas by their x coordinate and their y coordinate.

32
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:52,299
This being the x axis, and this being the y axis, right?

33
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,172
OK this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

34
00:01:56,172 --> 00:02:01,080
so this would be at pixel number 9 the way that I drew this.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,609
What do I mean by pixel?

36
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:05,141
We have these units of measurement in life, right?

37
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:09,121
In the world, we have inches and centimeters and miles and kilometers,

38
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:12,346
well on a computer screen, our unit of measurement is a pixel.

39
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:16,348
Each pixel is a little tiny dot that has a color on your screen.

40
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:20,030
This window has a width in pixels and a height in pixels, and in fact,

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,517
the ones that we are gonna work with in this tutorial are going to have

42
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:29,701
a width of 500 and a height of 400.

43
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,838
So if you think about it, if the width is 500 and this is the middle,

44
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:37,562
what would the middle pixel value be? 250.

45
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:41,565
I didn't really draw this terribly to scale, but if this were the middle,

46
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:44,828
what would the middle from 0-400 be? 200.

47
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:50,050
And in fact, we're going to need to plug these values into our rectangle function.

48
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,210
Now I need more space to write so I'm going to start writing rectangle down here again.

49
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,178
Rectangle, and now we're going to need parentheses.

50
00:02:56,178 --> 00:03:00,052
Parentheses, and at the end, a semicolon.

51
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:05,150
Every line of code, every instruction that we write is going to end with a semicolon.

52
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,370
It's going to be the function name,

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,039
followed by parentheses with stuff in the middle that we'll see in a second, and a semicolon.

54
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,192
What goes in the middle? Well this is that stuff.

55
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,018
This is the parameters of the rectangle.

56
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:21,148
It's how wide is it, how high is it, and where is it x,y.

57
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:25,125
So by the way, the rectangle's coordinate is the top left of the rectangle.

58
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:30,004
It's x,y, which is at x = 250, y = 200.

59
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:34,226
250, 200.

60
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:39,273
So we are now adding these parameters to how we define a rectangle, with an x and a y,

61
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:40,955
and now let's give it a width.

62
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:45,678
Let's say the width of this rectangle is 150 and the height of this rectangle is 100.

63
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:55,076
So now we have an x, we have a y, and now we also have a width and we also have a height.

64
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,237
Whoa, big moment here!

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,590
This is a big moment in our computer programming lives

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,750
if you've never done computer programming before, this is your very first line of code.

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,205
We now have a function name, we have the arguments to that function,

68
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,234
where is that rectangle?

69
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,967
Where is its x, where is its y, what is its width, and what is its height?

70
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,545
As soon as we write this line of code and execute it,

71
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:20,141
we're going to see this rectangle on the screen.

72
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,607
OK, so now something really exciting is gonna happen, hopefully.

73
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:27,189
I'm gonna get much smaller, I'm suddenly in the corner of the window,

74
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:29,064
and below me, there's a code editor.

75
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:32,083
What's a code editor? A code editor is a place where you can type code.

76
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,779
It's just a text box; you can type and put stuff there.

77
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,517
What are you gonna put there? This.

78
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:37,550
This instruction.

79
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,367
You don't have to do the typing yet, you're gonna get your chance;

80
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:42,113
I'm actually gonna add that line of code for you there automatically.

81
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,494
Look, that line of code is there. Does it look the same?

82
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:50,060
rect (250, 200, 150, 100);

83
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,399
That's the line of code.

84
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,893
So now, where are we gonna see the results of that line of code? Right over here.

85
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:58,068
Right over here, that canvas is going to appear.

86
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,836
How big is that canvas going to be?

87
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:04,087
That canvas is going to be 500 pixels wide and 400 pixels high.

88
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:07,207
Notice, by the way, that there's nothing in the canvas right now,

89
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,995
but I'm going to add some rulers above and below.

90
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,949
Those rulers are going to show you where the pixels are,

91
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,624
so as you're trying to figure out where to draw stuff, those rulers will be helpful hints for you.

92
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,577
You can always toggle the rulers off with the toggle rulers button.

93
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:22,053
See? I toggled them off. See? I toggled them on.

94
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:23,247
Boy this is fun!

95
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,758
OK, now, uh, whoa, what do we gotta do?

96
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,188
OK, that code below? That rectangle?

97
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,786
It's time for us to run that code. I'm going to run it for you.

98
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:33,856
Do you see the rectangle there? That's the instruction, now you've got the rectangle.

99
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,299
We ran our first computer program; it's very exciting,

100
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:39,235
and now, now it's time for you to make a change.

101
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,658
To change the code and run your first computer program.

102
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,250
So try doing something like, just make the rectangle a little bit taller.

103
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,769
Instead of a height of 100, what if you give it a height of 200?

104
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,477
Change the number from 100 to 200.

105
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,207
Did you change that number?

106
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,799
Now look, I'm gonna add a button called "run this code,"

107
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:02,363
that button, if you press it, will execute the code that you've written.

108
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:07,095
Press that button. Do you see now that the rectangle is a little bit bigger?

109
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:08,675
Try making one more change.

110
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:11,019
Maybe move the rectangle to the left or right and run your code again.

111
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,855
You got it! Looks pretty good to me.

112
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,890
OK great, you know, you can always pause the video if you want more time to experiment.

113
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,703
So just pause the video, experiment, and hit play, and I'll keep talking.

114
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,150
You could also just pause the video if you wanted to stop listening to me talk;

115
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,614
that's quite OK with me.

116
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,321
OK, so this is really the fundamentals we've got here.

117
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:35,247
What I'm going to be asking you to do is make up your own design.

118
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,100
You can have more than one rectangle, right?

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,258
Below, I'm going to add 2 more rectangles.

120
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,886
Now there's 3 rectangles on the screen.

121
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:44,858
OK? So you can start to add them, put them in different places, but you know what?

122
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:48,494
You're probably going to feel quite limited to what kind of designs you can make

123
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:50,778
if all you could ever do is draw a rectangle,

124
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:54,751
so let's add one more shape to our set of shapes that we can draw.

125
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:58,322
The nice thing is we're just writing a new function, a new command,

126
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:00,323
and it's exactly the same thing as rectangle;

127
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:03,239
the only difference is we write the word ellipse,

128
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:09,176
and now we give the ellipse an x, the ellipse a y, the ellipse a width, and the ellipse a height.

129
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:12,112
With an ellipse, or at least a circle, when we think of a circle,

130
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,812
we think of a circle as having a diameter.

131
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:20,965
A diameter is the distance from one side of the circle to the other through the center.

132
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:22,874
So that's what a circle is.

133
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:27,102
But an ellipse can be something that's like a squashed circle that's very short,

134
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:32,081
or maybe very tall and thin, like this is an ellipse, or this is an ellipse.

135
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:36,234
And in these cases, we have a different height and a different width. Right?

136
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,876
The width and height, if they're equal, it's a circle, if they're different, it's an ellipse.

137
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,785
If you ever make these values equal, like if I say 200, 200,

138
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:50,214
and if I put this at the same location, 250, 200, we're going to get a circle.

139
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:52,651
Now where is that circle going to be?

140
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:57,541
When we drew our rectangle, we gave it an x, y location. 250, 200.

141
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:02,694
That's this point. This rectangle is drawn with that point being the corner of the rectangle.

142
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:08,510
A circle, an ellipse, is different. The x, y point we're defining is the center of that circle.

143
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:15,788
So here is our 200 pixel by, 200 pixel wide and 200 pixel tall circle.

144
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,309
It's right there. With the x, y at the center.

145
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,429
So our code editor now just has one rectangle.

146
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:24,295
It's that rectangle we drew below, and there it is in the canvas.

147
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:29,059
Let's add this line of code here, the ellipse. Let's put that ellipse there.

148
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:30,320
And I'm going to run it for you.

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,582
Look, there's the ellipse!

150
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:33,610
Now, notice something a bit strange here.

151
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,063
The ellipse is covering up the rectangle.

152
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:38,688
This brings up a very important point in terms of programming computer graphics.

153
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:42,438
The order that we write our lines of code is incredibly important, right?

154
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,969
Because if the rectangle is drawn first, the ellipse is drawn second, the ellipse is drawn on top of it.

155
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:51,501
Now, I'm going to swap those lines of code, I switch them, and run it again.

156
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,128
Notice now the rectangle is on top of the ellipse.

157
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:57,823
So how you choose to write the order of the shapes that you're drawing,

158
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,805
it's really an important point in creating your design.

159
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:04,503
Alright, I think we've really come to the end of this first tutorial,

160
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,601
and it's time now for you to do your first exercise.

161
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,822
I'm going to leave you with a code example that you can use to get started from.

162
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:14,646
So I'm filling in below a nice code example, you can see the design over here.

163
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:17,360
And what you should work on is try to make your own design.

164
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,578
You can make a self-portrait, or a creature or an alien.

165
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,868
Something friendly or scary, whatever you think.

166
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:23,991
You can design a building.

167
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:28,266
Any simple design that you can do with rectangles and ellipses.

168
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:32,720
You can use this example to build off of, or you can just erase it and start from scratch.

169
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,726
So take a little time to do this exercise.

170
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:37,893
When you're done, select that you're ready, and the next video will appear,

171
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,150
and we're gonna take the, in the next video, we're gonna do

172
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,397
what you're probably wondering about already, which is like,

173
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:45,879
"uh, can I make these red or blue or some color that I want?"

174
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,982
After you do your exercise we're going to introduce color.

175
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:54,233
So enjoy and I look forward to seeing you back, if you come back, for the next tutorial.

176
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,925
OK, bye bye.
