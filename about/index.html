	<h2> About </h2>

	<p>
		This sequence of tutorials was produced by the Processing Foundation as a part of <a href="http://code.org/">Code.org</a>'s Hour of Codeâ„¢ 2013 initiative to introduce students to computer programming. The program launched during <a href="http://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a>, 9-15 December 2013 with the goal of giving millions of students the opportunity to explore coding as a way of thinking and making.

		Our contribution uses Processing, a programming platform designed to bring programming to visual arts communities and to bring technical fields closer to the visual arts. Processing is used to teach programming principles within the context of visual media. The Processing software is free to download and is open source. Visit the <a href="http://processing.org">Processing website</a> to download it and learn more.
