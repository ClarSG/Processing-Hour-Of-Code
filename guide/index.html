	<h2> Teacher's Guide </h2>

	<p>
		The primary goals of the tutorial are to provide an introduction to computer programming within the context of visual media in a way that encourages future exploration and creates enthusiasm for coding. This tutorial was created to allow people to make their way through at their own pace, but it can also be more structured for a classroom envionment. This set of tutorials will take about an hour. Each section is a video introduction followed by time to write and modify a program. The primary material for each section is described below. For discussion or questions about this tutorial, please visit the <a href="http://forum.processing.org/two/categories/hello-processing">Processing Forum</a>.
	</p>

	<h5> Hello </h5>

	<p>
		What is computer programming and why is it interesting? A series of examples demonstrate how code is used within the visual arts in areas including animation, cartography, performance, architecture, and fashion design.
	</p>

	<h5> Shapes </h5>

	<p>
		Shapes are drawn to the screen with the <tt>ellipse()</tt> and <tt>rect()</tt> programming <em>functions</em>. A series of parameter values are used to define the position and size of the shapes. These numerical parameters relate to the <em>coordinate system</em>.  
	</p>

	<h5> Color </h5>

	<p>
		Shapes are colored with the <tt>fill()</tt> and <tt>stroke()</tt> functions.
	</p>

	<h5> Interact </h5>

	<p>
		Input is used to move animate shapes. The location of the cursor on screen controlled with a mouse or finger is used to set the position of ellipses and rectangles on the screen. The x-coordinate of the cursor is captured as the <tt>mouseX</tt> variable in the program and the y-coordinate of the cursor is the <tt>mouseY</tt> variable. These positional values are used to define the location of shapes on screen. As the cursor moves, the shapes respond.
	</p>

	<h5> Decisions </h5>

	<p>
		Touch and/or mouse click events decide if the code does one thing or another. For example, will the color be green or blue; will an ellipse or square draw? The program asks a question through a short <em>relational expression</em> and if the answer is <em>true</em>, the code inside the <em>block</em>, the line(s) of code between the '{' and '}' symbols, runs.
